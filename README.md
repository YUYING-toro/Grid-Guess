# -Grid-Guess
Grid & Guess is a fun word puzzle game where players erase tiles on an 8Ã—8 grid to reveal a hidden word. I designed and developed the game entirely in Python using the graphics.Canvas module, focusing on smooth interaction and playful visuals. This project helped me strengthen my Python fundamentals and improve my skills in handling graphics and user interaction.
